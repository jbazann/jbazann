```
Beyond many layers of abstraction hides a shattered heart.
  Rearranging its atomic components, it shall fulfill the contracts of a polymorphic world.

Between thick walls of encapsulation echoes a constant beat.
  Iterating over its truth, it shall coerce itself into responses.

In its flesh is behavior carved by declarative frameworks.
  Threading needles of principle, it shall implement the perfect patterns.

Far out of scope are the images of its release.
  Parsing endless documentation, it shall search the undefined.
```
